# HuffmanCompressor
A  program that can losslessly compress and decompress files using Huffman Encoding


## Working


### Compression
1. Find frequencies of characters and generate a Huffman Tree
2. Traverse, and assign bitcodes to each character, and store in map
3. Using this info, create a bitstring of the input file
4. Read this bitstring in chunks of 8, using OR and SHIFT operations to get the byte
5. Write these bytes to file

### Decompression

1. Generate bitstring of compressed file
2. Go through each bit, comparing with the huffman codes, and appending characters to a vector on match
3. Write this vector to the file, which would be our uncompressed version


## Issues

1. There's a bug in which if you have equal frequencies, it doesn't work properly
2. In the implementation, we're appending zeroes to make the bitstring length a multiple of 8. Due to this, during the decompression phase, some unwanted characters are added(At most 7). This can be fixed by storing the amount we padded in the file.

## To Do

1. Store the padded amount in the file
2. Store the table in the file header so that we don't need to depend externally
3. Fix the same frequency bug
